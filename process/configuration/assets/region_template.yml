## Study region configuration template v5.0.0 (3 Apri 2024)

## This configuration file uses the YAML format (https://yaml.org/) to describe the data sources, parameters and metadata used to analyse and generate urban indicator resources using the Global Healthy and Sustainable City Indicators software (https://global-healthy-liveable-cities.github.io/).

## Text begining with a double hash symbol ("##") is are comments (used to provide descriptions of how to complete the item immediately below).  Text beginning with a single has symbol ("#") are commented out section of code that may optionally be uncommented as per the provided instructions.

## Optional sections that contain parameters which may be uncommented are marked with a series of hash symbols ("###########") at their start and end lines.

## If entering or modifying a parameter
## - leave a space after the semi-colon
## - indents (ie. 4 spaces) signify a nested sub-list of configurable parameters

## It is recomemnded to view or edit this file in an application providing syntax highlighting, for example, the provided Jupyter Lab web app:
## - type 'lab' at the GHSCI prompt
## - navigate to the "process/configuration/region/" folder in the browser pane
## - double click on the YAML configuration file with name ending in .yml you wish to edit

This has been done because the point indicators were sampled along the pedestrian network and are therefore unlikely to intersect with buildings.

## Network analysis related configuration parameters
network:
    #########
    ## Optional network parameters for use in some contexts (eg. island cities)
    ## Whether to only retain main connected network when retrieving OSM roads (set to "false"; the default, which is appropriate for most settings); or retain network 'islands' if present ("true")
    # osmnx_retain_all: false
    ## Whether to extract the network for the buffered study region. It is recommended to set to 'true' (the default) in most cases.  Setting this to false may be appropriate for true islands, but could be problematic for anywhere else where the network and associated amenities may be accessible beyond the edge of the study region boundary).
    # buffered_region: true
    ## Iterate over and combine polygons (this may be appropriate for a series of islands, like Hong Kong), but in most cases it is recommended to be set as false
    # polygon_iteration: false
    ## Minimum total network distance for subgraphs to retain.  This is a useful parameter for customising analysis for islands, like Hong Kong, but for most purposes you can leave this blank (the default).
    # connection_threshold:
    #########
    ## Tolerance in metres for cleaning intersections.  If not providing your own data for evaluating intersection density (see below), this is an important methodological choice.  The chosen parameter should be robust to a variety of network topologies in the city being studied.  See https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/main/notebooks/04-simplify-graph-consolidate-nodes.ipynb. For example, 12
